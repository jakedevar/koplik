# Sources

Every external source Koplik ingests: where it lives, the terms it comes with, how often it
changes and when someone last checked. The `source_id` is the id carried in every provenance
record; the `licence_id` is defined in the licence table below. A row marked **operator
decision required before publishing** must not feed anything public until the operator
clears it (AGENTS.md: accepting a data licence is an operator decision).

| source_id | Source | Exact URL (as recorded in provenance) | Licence id | Cadence | Last verified |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `cdc-nndss-weekly-measles` | CDC NNDSS Weekly Data, measles rows (data.cdc.gov dataset `x9gk-5huc`) | see "CDC NNDSS query" below | `cdc-open-data-terms-unconfirmed` | Weekly (CDC republishes the weekly tables; dataset last updated 2026-09-30) | 2026-10-07 |

## Licences and terms

| licence_id | Terms | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cdc-open-data-terms-unconfirmed` | The dataset page and its metadata name no licence (`license: null`); the publisher is CDC's Office of Public Health Data, Surveillance, and Technology (contact `NNDSSWeb@cdc.gov`). CDC data is a US federal agency product, but nobody has confirmed the reuse terms for this dataset. The dataset's own notes say counts are provisional, subject to ongoing revision, and "presented as published each week". | **Operator decision required before publishing.** Koplik shows the figures only with their provenance and the demonstration disclaimer; confirm the terms (or ask CDC) before the site goes public. |

## CDC NNDSS weekly measles cases by state (`cdc-nndss-weekly-measles`)

**Query (exact URL, built by `koplik-ingest`, recorded in every provenance record):**

```
https://data.cdc.gov/resource/x9gk-5huc.json?$select=states,year,week,label,m3,m3_flag&$where=label%20in%28%27Measles,%20Indigenous%27,%27Measles,%20Imported%27%29%20AND%20year%20in%28%272025%27,%272026%27%29&$order=year,week,states,label&$limit=50000
```

i.e. `$select=states,year,week,label,m3,m3_flag`, `$where=label in('Measles, Indigenous','Measles, Imported') AND year in('2025','2026')`,
`$order=year,week,states,label`, `$limit=50000` (a response with 50,000 rows is refused as possibly truncated;
the real response has 12,740). `koplik-ingest fetch cdc-cases --first-year Y --last-year Y` builds the
same query for other years. A re-fetch with the same URL is reproducible; the data behind it changes weekly.

**Why this source.** NNDSS Weekly Data is the only CDC source found that publishes a weekly series per
state through a documented API, with a stable schema, explicit missing-value flags and every report
week kept as its own row (2025 weeks 1-53 and 2026 so far). The CDC "Measles Cases and Outbreaks"
page could not be used: an automated request to `https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html`
returned HTTP 403 on 2026-10-07 (and I did not work around the block), so it cannot be fetched
reproducibly. data.cdc.gov's `robots.txt` allows `/resource/` with `Crawl-delay: 1`.

**Client identification.** Requests send `koplik-ingest/<version> (measles data demonstration project)`. No
contact is sent until the operator verifies one and sets `KOPLIK_CONTACT`, which is then appended.

**Columns used.** `states` (reporting jurisdiction name), `year` and `week` (MMWR reporting year and
week of the weekly table), `label` (`Measles, Indigenous` or `Measles, Imported`), `m3` (cumulative
year-to-date count as published that week), `m3_flag` (`-`, `U`, `N`, `NN`, `NP`, `NC` when there is no
number). `m1` ("current week") is not used.

**How weekly counts are derived** (`crates/koplik-ingest/src/cdc.rs`, tested against the recorded fixture):

1. The weekly table's own "current week" column (`m1`) leaves out cases that are added to earlier weeks:
   for Texas 2025 its weeks sum to 288 while the published cumulative ends at 803. The cumulative `m3` is
   the complete accounting, so weekly new cases are the week-over-week difference of `m3`
   (week 1 of a year: `m3` itself).
2. Per state, `m3` is first summed over Indigenous + Imported (and, for New York, over the separately
   reporting New York State and New York City), then differenced. A case reclassified between Imported
   and Indigenous therefore does not read as a decrease (it happens in the real data: California 2025
   week 35).
3. "Week" is the MMWR **reporting** week of the CDC table, i.e. when cases reached CDC, not the onset
   week. It lags onset by days to weeks and the most recent weeks are provisional; downstream
   R_t code must treat it that way.
4. Missing stays missing, never zero. No row for a week: `not_reported`. Flags `U`, `N`, `NN`, `NP`,
   `NC`: `not_reported`. A cumulative that falls (the 16 cases in the fixture are corrections, e.g.
   California 2025 week 34: 20 -> 19), a value that is not a whole non-negative number, or a week
   that follows a missing cumulative: `ambiguous`. The flag `-` ("No reported cases") means the
   jurisdiction reports and has none, so a cumulative of `-` is a real zero.
5. Geographies are the 50 states, DC and 5 territories keyed by state FIPS (56). Regional and national
   totals and `Non-U.S. Residents` are skipped; an unrecognised jurisdiction name is an error.
6. Case classification (inference, not a direct statement for measles). CDC's guide to the weekly
   tables says each table publishes the case classifications (confirmed, probable, suspected) set per
   condition in the "Publication Criteria" column of its Event (disease/condition) Code List, and that
   the counts are provisional cases "that meet the publication criteria". The review of this connector
   cites that criteria table as listing measles as confirmed only. I verified the general rule in the
   guide (<https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/wp-content/uploads/guide_to_interpreting_provisional_and_finalized_nndss_data_tables.pdf>)
   and that the measles footnote of a weekly table defines only imported versus indigenous, not the
   classification; I did not read the measles row of the criteria table myself. So treating
   `WeeklyCaseCount.confirmed` as confirmed cases is an inference from CDC's publication criteria,
   not something the dataset states. The UI should say "cases as reported to NNDSS" until the
   criteria row has been checked for the year in question.
